Websites that use Exoclick monetization service use the following URLs and scripts on their websites, which means that seeing this is a way of verifying that a website uses Exoclick service.

```bash
  Domains list:
1. a.realsrv.com/ads.js
2. syndication.realsrv.com
3. syndication.exdynsrv.com

One way to check if these domains are active on an illegal porn website is by checking the URLs that appear when you click on an ad or unannounced pop-up window. also checking incoming browser connections.
